# Mann Upadhyay  

**`Software Engineer`**  

Hey there 👋 I'm Mann, a curious developer who loves exploring **everything from low-level system programming** to **building full-stack applications**.  
I enjoy digging into how computers really work under the hood, while also creating projects that live on the web.  I don’t like limiting myself to just one label.  
Whether it’s **writing efficient C code**, **designing backend systems**, or **crafting web apps**, I’m always learning, experimenting, and building.
